## üìà Projects

### Optiver - Trading Prediction Model

 Project Overview
In this project, I developed a predictive model to forecast Nasdaq stock price movements using advanced machine learning techniques. The focus was on optimizing prediction accuracy through effective feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

 Key Objectives
- **Price Prediction**: Accurately predict stock price movements on the Nasdaq exchange.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Utilize machine learning to improve the precision of predictions based on market data.

 Methodology
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Implemented **LightGBM** for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Developed features that capture essential market dynamics and price movement signals.

 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The primary metric for evaluating the model's performance, ensuring that the predictions closely align with observed values.

### Store Sales Time Series Forecasting
Created a machine learning model using five years of historical data to forecast retail store demand over the next 15 days. Focused on exploratory data analysis for feature selection.

 Key Objectives
- Enhance sales prediction accuracy, addressing challenges like overstocking and stockouts in grocery retail. Improved forecasting can reduce food waste and enhance customer satisfaction.

 Methodology
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Implemented **LightGBM** for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets.

Evaluation Metrics
- **Root mean square Error (RMSE)**

### Depression Prediction Model using Machine Learning
Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of depression based on demographic and behavioral features. Focused on data cleaning, feature engineering, and model optimization to improve accuracy and interpretability.

Key Objectives

- Predict the likelihood of depression among individuals using demographic, lifestyle, and behavioral data.
Improve model accuracy and generalizability to make reliable predictions, aiding in early detection of mental health issues.
Address challenges such as missing data and incorrect values, ensuring the model can handle real-world data imperfections.

Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and imputed missing values, handled outliers, and standardized categorical data using techniques like mode imputation and One-Hot Encoding.
- Machine Learning Algorithm: Built and optimized a Decision Tree Classifier, incorporating cost complexity pruning for improved accuracy and model interpretability.
- Cross-validation: Used cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and select the best alpha value for pruning, ensuring the model's robustness.

Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Gini Index

### Chennai House Price Prediction
