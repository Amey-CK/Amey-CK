## üìà Projects

### Optiver - Trading Prediction Model

 Project Overview
In this project, I developed a predictive model to forecast Nasdaq stock price movements using advanced machine learning techniques. The focus was on optimizing prediction accuracy through effective feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

 Key Objectives
- **Price Prediction**: Accurately predict stock price movements on the Nasdaq exchange.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Utilize machine learning to improve the precision of predictions based on market data.

 Methodology
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Implemented **LightGBM** for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Developed features that capture essential market dynamics and price movement signals.

 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The primary metric for evaluating the model's performance, ensuring that the predictions closely align with observed values.

### Store Sales Time Series Forecasting
Created a machine learning model using five years of historical data to forecast retail store demand over the next 15 days. Focused on exploratory data analysis for feature selection.

 Key Objectives
- Enhance sales prediction accuracy, addressing challenges like overstocking and stockouts in grocery retail. Improved forecasting can reduce food waste and enhance customer satisfaction.

 Methodology
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Implemented **LightGBM** for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets.

Evaluation Metrics
- **Root mean square Error (RMSE)**

### Chennai House Price Prediction
Used real-life data to predict house prices in Chennai. Implemented and compared various models, including **Linear Regression**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
